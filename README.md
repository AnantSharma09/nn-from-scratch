Neural Network From Scratch (NumPy Only) 

Building a neural network completely from scratch using only NumPy. 
No deep learning frameworks. No shortcuts. 
Goal is to understand every moving part behind training a neural network. 

Why I'm Doing This 

To build real foundational intuition for deep learning instead of relying on libraries blindly. 
I want to understand how neural networks work internally at the level of matrix math, gradients, backpropagation, and optimization. 

Learning Log 

I am documenting the full process step-by-step in this repo as I build the network from scratch. 
Notes + derivations will be added along the way. 

Goals 

Understand forward & backward pass deeply 

Implement working neural network with NumPy 

Build muscle memory for matrix-based thinking 

Use this as base for future: CNNs, RNNs, Transformers 

Future Extensions 

Add Adam optimizer 

Add modular layer system 

Rewrite in PyTorch after finishing to compare behavior
